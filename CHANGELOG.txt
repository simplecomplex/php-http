KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-16
--------------------------
- HttpClient support HTTP method aliases index|retrieve (GET),
  create (POST), update (PUT), delete (DELETE).
- Args provider, service and endpoint must be lisp cased; underscore could break
  configuration ini filename uniqueness, dot ditto for validation JSON filename.
- Swapped sequence of HttpResponseBody success and status properties; success
  is more important than status.
- Response headers are now set as HttpRequest inst. var responseHeaders, instead
  directly on HttpResponse; because HttpResponse->headers should be the headers
  (if any) to be sent to requestor, not all remote headers indiscriminately.
- Validation now only works on response body data, not on the whole response.
  Because that would make for far too complex validation rule sets.
  And the user of HttpClient can still investigate status and headers, prior
  to running any body data validation.
- Validation now supports variants; multiple validation rule sets.

--------------------------
- HttpRequest must evaluate HttpResponse; not HttpResponse itself.
  When (later) implementing a validate feature, that must be able to validate
  the whole response (including status and headers); not body data only.
