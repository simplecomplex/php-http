  Removed warnings from documentation.

- .cross_origin_allow_sites file renamed; from .access_control_allow_origin.
- Cross origin Access-Control-Allow-Origin header must only be returned when
  when such site requests, and only contain it's _own_ protocol, host and port;
  and port only if request header Origin contains port.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-09-03
----------------------------------
- Slim initialization generalized and moved to HttpServiceSlim.
- HttpServiceSlim is now the overall bootstrapper,
  of Slim and the simplecomplex framework.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-09-02
----------------------------------
- Mock and validation rule set caches allow long keys; length 128.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-31
----------------------------------
- Response mocking turned off globally in production.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-29
----------------------------------
- HttpClient option log_warning_on_status, primarily to prevent log flood
  of 504 Bad Gateway events.
- Constants that right belong to HttpClient moved from HttpRequest.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-28
----------------------------------
- Cross origin pre-request OPTIONS request support; to allow/support
  custom request headers.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-23
----------------------------------
- Application title is now retrieved from dependency injection container;
  no longer a HttpClient constructor parameter.
- Cross Origin allowed sites are now set in file
  [document root]/.access_control_allow_origin, instead of ini derived config;
  because otherwise Slim PHP and exception handlers cannot be trusted to be able
  to access that list.
- Bash setup script support 'environment' argument, dev|prod.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-22
----------------------------------
- Log response body on response validation failure; separate warning log event.
- Do discern between service (as AJAX request receiver) and client (as remote
  service requestor).
- Prefab HttpResponseRequestInvalid to send when frontend request arguments
  fail _request_ validation.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-20
----------------------------------
- Response validation fully implemented.
- Response mocking fully implemented.
- HttpClient instance can't have state related to endpoint, method or request;
  would cripple reusability.
- HttpClient::getInstance() for reusability across scopes.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-19
----------------------------------
- mock_response option.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-18
----------------------------------
- Set remote response headers on HttpResponse instead of on HttpRequest.
- Set 'validated' on HttpResponse instead of on HttpRequest.
- Cacheable response must be saved to cache on access/retrieval;
  as late as possible.
- Set iso-8601 date header X-Http-Cache-Time on response when caching.
- - - -
- Validation has to be executed privately; otherwise double response
  access/retrieval (before and after validation) could result in bad
  (unvalidated) cache - cached before validation, what to do upon bad
  validation (cache deletion would not secure that other requestors don't
  get bad response in the meantime).
- Setting/option validate_response is the way to command validation.
- Implemented require_response_headers check.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-17
----------------------------------
- Dot-separated operation name; provider.service.endpoint.METHODorAlias.
- Service ini config names dot-separated.
- HttpRequest set response headers X-Http-Original-Status
  and X-Http-Final-Status.
  The 'final' status will always be set; the 'original' status may not be set
  if the request failed without contact with remote service.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-16
----------------------------------
- HttpClient support HTTP method aliases index|retrieve (GET),
  create (POST), update (PUT), delete (DELETE).
- Args provider, service and endpoint must be lisp cased; underscore could break
  configuration ini filename uniqueness, dot ditto for validation JSON filename.
- Swapped sequence of HttpResponseBody success and status properties; success
  is more important than status.
- Response headers are now set as HttpRequest inst. var responseHeaders, instead
  directly on HttpResponse; because HttpResponse->headers should be the headers
  (if any) to be sent to requestor, not all remote headers indiscriminately.
- Validation now only works on response body data, not on the whole response.
  Because that would make for far too complex validation rule sets.
  And the user of HttpClient can still investigate status and headers, prior
  to running any body data validation.
- Validation now supports variants; multiple validation rule sets.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-12
----------------------------------
- Slim service helper HttpServiceSlim.
- This library, Http, must deliver Access-Control-Allow-Origin config setting.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-11
----------------------------------
- HttpClient/HttpRequest error handling complete.
- HttpClient::request() support numerically indexed path, query, body arguments.
- HttpClient::request() return HttpRequest; not HttpResponse.
- 'cacheable' is only allowed on 'method' config level and/or as option.
- Works, at least against a 'host_not_found' host.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-10
----------------------------------
- HttpRequest must evaluate HttpResponse; not HttpResponse itself.
  When (later) implementing a validate feature, that must be able to validate
  the whole response (including status and headers); not body data only.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-09
----------------------------------
- New option retry_on_unavailable; 503 Service Unavailable or host not found.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-08
----------------------------------
- Client, response and response body done. Request error handling missing.

SimpleComplex/Http 1.x, 2017-08-04
