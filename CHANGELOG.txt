KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-22
--------------------------
- Log response body on response validation failure; separate warning log event.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-20
--------------------------
- Response validation fully implemented.
- Response mocking fully implemented.
- HttpClient instance can't have state related to endpoint, method or request;
  would cripple reusability.
- HttpClient::getInstance() for reusability across scopes.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-19
--------------------------
- mock_response option.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-18
--------------------------
- Set remote response headers on HttpResponse instead of on HttpRequest.
- Set 'validated' on HttpResponse instead of on HttpRequest.
- Cacheable response must be saved to cache on access/retrieval;
  as late as possible.
- Set iso-8601 date header X-KkSeb-Http-Cache-Time on response when caching.
- - - -
- Validation has to be executed privately; otherwise double response
  access/retrieval (before and after validation) could result in bad
  (unvalidated) cache - cached before validation, what to do upon bad
  validation (cache deletion would not secure that other requestors don't
  get bad response in the meantime).
- Setting/option validate_response is the way to command validation.
- Implemented require_response_headers check.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-17
--------------------------
- Dot-separated operation name; provider.service.endpoint.METHODorAlias.
- Service ini config names dot-separated.
- HttpRequest set response headers X-KkSeb-Http-Original-Status
  and X-KkSeb-Http-Final-Status.
  The 'final' status will always be set; the 'original' status may not be set
  if the request failed without contact with remote service.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-16
--------------------------
- HttpClient support HTTP method aliases index|retrieve (GET),
  create (POST), update (PUT), delete (DELETE).
- Args provider, service and endpoint must be lisp cased; underscore could break
  configuration ini filename uniqueness, dot ditto for validation JSON filename.
- Swapped sequence of HttpResponseBody success and status properties; success
  is more important than status.
- Response headers are now set as HttpRequest inst. var responseHeaders, instead
  directly on HttpResponse; because HttpResponse->headers should be the headers
  (if any) to be sent to requestor, not all remote headers indiscriminately.
- Validation now only works on response body data, not on the whole response.
  Because that would make for far too complex validation rule sets.
  And the user of HttpClient can still investigate status and headers, prior
  to running any body data validation.
- Validation now supports variants; multiple validation rule sets.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-12
--------------------------
- Slim service helper HttpServiceSlim.
- This library, Http, must deliver Access-Control-Allow-Origin config setting.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-11
--------------------------
- HttpClient/HttpRequest error handling complete.
- HttpClient::request() support numerically indexed path, query, body arguments.
- HttpClient::request() return HttpRequest; not HttpResponse.
- 'cacheable' is only allowed on 'method' config level and/or as option.
- Works, at least against a 'host_not_found' host.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-10
--------------------------
- HttpRequest must evaluate HttpResponse; not HttpResponse itself.
  When (later) implementing a validate feature, that must be able to validate
  the whole response (including status and headers); not body data only.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-09
--------------------------
- New option retry_on_unavailable; 503 Service Unavailable or host not found.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-08
--------------------------
- Client, response and response body done. Request error handling missing.

KkSeb/Http 1.x, 2017-08-04
--------------------------
- Initial.
